  "Story One: Mike is a Cook

Hi there.

These are stories that I want you to listen to.

They use the most common verbs in the language.

It's a place to practice basic structures in the language.

The story is told twice, and then there are questions.

And you can choose to answer the questions, or just listen to the answers that I provide.

So, story number one about Mike who works in a restaurant.

A) Mike gets up at six am every morning.

He makes breakfast and drinks a coffee.

He drives to work in his car.

His work starts at seven thirty am.

Mike is a cook at a restaurant.

He makes food for hungry customers.

The customers are from many countries.

They speak many different languages.

Mike can meet many friendly people.

Mike is happy when he talks to the customers.

Now I want you to listen to the same story, but this time told by Mike.

You'll notice it's a little different.

Here's Mike.
